# Agent Instructions Extraction & Generalization Update

## Overview

This update extracts the detailed agent instructions from the Rule of Thirds MCP server implementation and creates reusable, domain-agnostic instruction files. The changes make the system flexible for any topic or domain instead of being hardcoded to specific examples.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Agent Instructions Directory

Created `/agent-instructions/` with comprehensive instruction files:

- **`external-signals-agent.md`** - Market intelligence gathering instructions
- **`internal-research-agent.md`** - Internal document analysis instructions  
- **`product-metrics-agent.md`** - Product metrics collection instructions
- **`orchestration-instructions.md`** - Agent coordination and synthesis guidance
- **`README.md`** - Overview and usage guide

### 2. Removed Hardcoded Examples

#### Before (Hardcoded Examples):
```json
{
  "topic": "user_onboarding",
  "productArea": "mobile_app"
}
```

```javascript
title: "Industry Analysis: AI Trends Reshape Market Landscape"
content: "Users consistently mentioned that the onboarding process was confusing..."
source: "user-interviews-q3.vtt"
```

#### After (Generic Placeholders):
```json
{
  "topic": "[your_topic]",
  "productArea": "[your_product_area]"
}
```

```javascript
title: "Industry Analysis: [Topic] Trends Reshape Market Landscape"
content: "Users consistently mentioned that [specific feature/process] was confusing..."
source: "research-sessions.vtt"
```

### 3. Updated MCP Server Implementation

#### Files Modified:
- `src/agents/externalSignalsAgent.ts`
- Agent instruction comments and simulated data examples

#### Specific Changes:
- **"$50M funding"** → **"major funding"**
- **"67% increase"** → **"significant increase"**
- **"Tech Education Hub"** → **"Education Hub"**
- Verified all dynamic variables (`${topic}`, `${productArea}`) are properly used

### 4. Benefits of Changes

#### Domain Flexibility
Now supports any topic/domain combination:
- Healthcare: `("patient_engagement", "telehealth_platform")`
- Finance: `("investment_strategy", "trading_platform")`
- E-commerce: `("checkout_flow", "mobile_commerce")`
- Education: `("learning_outcomes", "online_courses")`

#### Reusability
- Instructions can be used independently in other projects
- Clear methodology documentation for each agent type
- Comprehensive configuration and error handling guidance

## Implementation Notes

### What Was Already Good
- Core MCP server implementation already used dynamic variables
- Agent coordination and parallel execution was domain-agnostic
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms were generic

### What Needed Updates
- Simulated data examples contained hardcoded values
- Instruction comments had specific domain references
- Configuration examples used fixed topic/product combinations

## Usage Examples

### Generic Configuration Template
```json
{
  "topic": "[your_topic]",
  "productArea": "[your_product_area]",
  "timeframe": "7d",
  "maxResults": 50,
  "outputFormat": "comprehensive"
}
```

### MCP Tool Usage
```javascript
// Any domain works now
await mcp.call("analyze_market_trends", {
  topic: "supply_chain_optimization",
  productArea: "logistics_platform"
});

await mcp.call("triangulate_signals", {
  topic: "customer_retention", 
  productArea: "subscription_service"
});
```

## Verification

### Checked For and Removed:
- ✅ Hardcoded topic examples (`user_onboarding`, `mobile_app`, etc.)
- ✅ Domain-specific content (`AI trends`, `67%`, `$50M`, etc.)
- ✅ Specific file names (`user-interviews-q3.vtt`)
- ✅ Industry-specific channel names (`Tech Education Hub`)

### Verified Dynamic Usage:
- ✅ All `${topic}` and `${productArea}` variables working correctly
- ✅ Simulated data adapts to any input topic
- ✅ Configuration examples use generic placeholders
- ✅ Instructions are domain-neutral

## Git Commits

1. **"Make agent instructions generic and topic-agnostic"** (ae0927a)
   - Created agent-instructions directory with 5 instruction files
   - Replaced hardcoded examples with generic placeholders
   - Added comprehensive README with usage guidance

2. **"Remove remaining hardcoded examples from MCP server agents"** (44464e1)
   - Updated simulated data in externalSignalsAgent.ts
   - Made funding amounts and percentages generic
   - Ensured all channel names are domain-neutral

## Migration Guide for Forks

If you have a forked repository that needs these updates:

### 1. Copy New Files
```bash
# Copy the entire agent-instructions directory
cp -r agent-instructions/ /path/to/your/fork/

# Or create it manually using the content from this repo
```

### 2. Update Source Files
Apply these specific changes to `src/agents/externalSignalsAgent.ts`:

```diff
- content: `Venture capital firms announce $50M funding round for startups focusing on ${topic} innovation, signaling strong market confidence.`,
+ content: `Venture capital firms announce major funding round for startups focusing on ${topic} innovation, signaling strong market confidence.`,

- content: `New consumer research indicates 67% increase in ${topic} adoption over the past quarter, driven by improved user experience and cost reduction.`,
+ content: `New consumer research indicates significant increase in ${topic} adoption over the past quarter, driven by improved user experience and cost reduction.`,

- channel: 'Tech Education Hub',
+ channel: 'Education Hub',
```

### 3. Verify Dynamic Variables
Ensure all simulated data uses `${topic}` and `${productArea}` variables instead of hardcoded strings.

## Impact

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Works with any domain or topic
- **Better Documentation**: Clear instructions for each agent
- **Improved Maintainability**: Generic examples are easier to understand
- **Reusable Components**: Instructions can be used in other projects

## Future Considerations

These changes enable:
- Easy addition of new domains without code changes
- Clear onboarding for new team members
- Potential open-source sharing of the instruction methodology
- Integration with other Rule of Thirds implementations
