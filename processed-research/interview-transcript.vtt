00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Interviewer: Thank you for joining our research session about Bicep testing.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.200
Interviewer: Can you tell us about your experience with Bicep infrastructure deployments?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.300
User_Sarah: Sure, we've been using Bicep for about 2 years now for all our Azure infrastructure.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.100
User_Sarah: The biggest challenge is validating templates before they hit production environments.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.700
User_Sarah: We've had too many incidents where deployments failed due to issues we should have caught.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Interviewer: What testing and validation processes do you currently have in place?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.300
User_Sarah: We use the basic Bicep build command and some manual code reviews.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.100
User_Sarah: But there's no comprehensive testing framework for Bicep like there is for application code.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.800
User_Sarah: We need unit tests, integration tests, and policy validation all automated.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.500
Interviewer: How much time does your team spend on manual Bicep validation?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.200
User_Sarah: Probably 10-15 hours per week just reviewing templates and catching errors.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.300
User_Sarah: And even with that effort, we still get deployment failures in production.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.100
User_Sarah: A proper testing framework would save us so much time and reduce incidents.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.800
Interviewer: What would an ideal Bicep testing solution look like?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.500
User_Sarah: It needs to validate syntax, check against Azure policies, and test parameter combinations.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.200
User_Sarah: We also need dry-run capabilities to see what would be deployed without actually deploying.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.100
User_Sarah: Integration with CI/CD pipelines is critical, and it should provide detailed error messages.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.800
User_Sarah: Basically, treat infrastructure code with the same testing rigor as application code.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.500
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing these insights. This has been very helpful for our research.
