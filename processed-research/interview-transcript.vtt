00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Interviewer: Thank you for joining our product research session today.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.200
Interviewer: Can you tell us about your experience with AI-powered analytics tools?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.300
User_Sarah: Sure, I've been using various analytics platforms for about 5 years now.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.100
User_Sarah: The biggest challenge we face is getting actionable insights from all the data we collect.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.700
User_Sarah: Most tools give us charts and graphs, but they don't tell us what actions to take.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Interviewer: What would make an analytics tool more valuable for your team?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.300
User_Sarah: We need AI that can automatically identify trends and suggest next steps.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.100
User_Sarah: Something that can process multiple data sources and find correlations we might miss.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.800
User_Sarah: And honestly, we spend way too much time creating reports manually.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.500
Interviewer: How much time does your team currently spend on analytics and reporting?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.200
User_Sarah: Probably 15-20 hours per week across the whole team just for basic reporting.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.300
User_Sarah: If we could automate that and focus on strategic decisions instead, it would be huge.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.100
User_Sarah: The AI analytics needs to be smart enough to surface anomalies and opportunities.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.800
Interviewer: What's your biggest frustration with current analytics solutions?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.500
User_Sarah: They're too generic. Every company gets the same dashboards and metrics.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.200
User_Sarah: We need AI that learns our business context and provides personalized insights.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.100
User_Sarah: Also, the integration between different tools is terrible.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.800
User_Sarah: We have data in five different places and no unified view.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.500
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing those insights. This has been very helpful.
