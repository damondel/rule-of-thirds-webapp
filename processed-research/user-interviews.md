# User Interview Research Summary

## Interview Session 1 - DevOps Engineer

**Date:** September 25, 2025
**Participant:** Sarah Johnson, Senior DevOps Engineer
**Topic:** Bicep infrastructure deployment and testing challenges

### Key Findings

- Teams are struggling with validating Bicep templates before deployment to production
- Need for automated testing frameworks specifically designed for Bicep code
- Current validation process is manual and error-prone, leading to deployment failures
- Lack of integration testing tools to verify infrastructure configurations end-to-end

### Pain Points Identified

1. **Manual Validation**: Engineers spend hours manually reviewing Bicep templates for errors
2. **Deployment Failures**: 30% of deployments fail due to syntax or configuration issues not caught in testing
3. **Limited Testing Tools**: Existing testing frameworks don't adequately support Bicep validation
4. **Rollback Complexity**: When deployments fail, rollbacks are complicated and time-consuming

### Recommendations

- Implement automated Bicep template validation in CI/CD pipelines
- Develop comprehensive unit testing framework for Bicep modules
- Add integration testing to verify resource dependencies and configurations
- Create pre-deployment validation gates with detailed error reporting

## Interview Session 2 - Cloud Architect

**Date:** September 26, 2025
**Participant:** Michael Chen, Senior Cloud Architect
**Topic:** Bicep best practices and testing methodologies

### Key Insights

Michael highlighted several critical gaps in current Bicep testing and validation:

- **Static Analysis**: Need better linting and static analysis tools for Bicep templates
- **Parameter Validation**: Difficulty testing different parameter combinations and edge cases
- **Policy Compliance**: Ensuring Bicep deployments meet organizational security and compliance policies
- **Environment Parity**: Testing that infrastructure works consistently across dev, staging, and production

### Technical Requirements

1. Automated Bicep syntax validation and best practices checking
2. Integration with Azure Policy for compliance testing
3. Mock deployment testing without actual resource provisioning
4. Performance testing for large-scale infrastructure deployments

### Success Metrics Discussion

Michael emphasized that successful Bicep testing should:

- Reduce deployment failures by at least 70%
- Catch 95% of configuration errors before production deployment
- Enable infrastructure-as-code testing in local development environments
- Provide clear, actionable error messages for failed validations
